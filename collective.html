                                        <h4>UX/ UI</h4>
                                    </div>
                                </div>
                        <p>I wanted to create an app that displayed accurate news. My approach was to build it using smart contracts on the Ethereum Network, using a decentralised app infrastructure allowing immutable data and transactions to be a fraction of fiat currency. This is not achievable using third party payment systems today. I was lead to believe that if a service allowed you to share updates on the world around you and encouraged users to donate to promote the notions they found accurate; a space could be created without spam, hence more accurate news. However, I soon discovered that this was an ambitious feat; partly due to the physical limitations of the EVM and blockchain technology at the time and partly because of underestimating human behaviour. I was still interested in seeing how I could design the user-experience with a suitable user-interface to make this app,so I decided to create this as a bare-bones UX/UI project with descriptions of first-approach, basic application architecture. All Designs were made in Sketch.</p>
                        <h2>Creating a User:</h2>
                        <div class="row justify-content-center">
                                <div class="col-sm-4 py-4 text-center"><img src="images/SignUp.jpg" class="img-fluid" style="border: solid 1px grey;"></div>
                                <div class="col-sm-4 py-4 text-center"><img src="images/LogIn.jpg" class="img-fluid" style="border: solid 1px grey;"></div>
                        </div>
                        <p>Users register with username, email and password. The user data is a one-to-many relationship, where one user has many Feeds and Posts.</p>
                        <h2>Creating a Post:</h2>
                        <div class="row justify-content-center">
                                <div class="col-sm-4 py-4 text-center"><img src="images/Create-Post.jpg" class="img-fluid" style="border: solid 1px grey;"></div>
                        </div>
                        <p>The Post model contains fields which include: headline, textBody, topicTags, timeCreated, balance and fonts. Headlines are the initial thing users read, which are displayed on the user interface of the Feed in full- this is achieved by setting a character limit. The textBody is the content of the post. topicTags are used to sort the Post accordingly using a Sort Function when viewing a feed. Fonts are used to personalise your post (this would not be included in the MVP design of the app.) timeCreated is a value which is used along with balance in a calculation to determine the popularity of the Post. Balance is the recorded amount of donations to the Post. Each Post has its own id.</p>
                        <h2>Viewing a Post:</h2>
                        <div class="row justify-content-center">
                                <div class="col-sm-4 py-4 text-center"><img src="images/Show-Post.jpg" class="img-fluid" style="border: solid 1px grey;"></div>
                        </div>
                        <p>The headlines and a portion of the Post’s body can be seen when looking at a Feed. The higher rated posts reveal larger amounts of the Post’s Text Body. Clicking on the Post takes you to the Show Post page where the entirety of the post can be seen along with the option to save and donate to the Post.</p>
                        <h2>Creating a Feed:</h2>
                        <div class="row justify-content-center">
                                <div class="col-sm-4 py-4 text-center"><img src="images/Create-Feed.jpg" class="img-fluid" style="border: solid 1px grey;"></div>
                        </div>
                        <p>The Feed model has fields which include topics and sortBy. On the User Interface you select what topics you would like your feed to contain, you can select multiple topics. You can choose how the created Feed is sorted using the Sort By selector. A User can create many Feeds, so you can have specific Feeds dedicated to specific types of content.</p>
                        <h4>Sort By Selector:</h4>
                        <p>Choosing to sort by 'Popular' arranges the Posts by popularity which is done through an algorithm that determines a rate by looking at the balance of the post and dividing it by the amount of time it has been since it was created. Sorting by 'New' orders the Feed by the most recent posts only. You can also set a specific time when selecting New (in the last hour/ day/ month.)</p>
                        <h2>View Feeds:</h2>
                        <div class="row justify-content-center">
                                <div class="col-sm-4 py-4 text-center"><img src="images/Home-Page.jpg" class="img-fluid" style="border: solid 1px grey;"></div>
                                <div class="col-sm-4 py-4 text-center"><img src="images/Home-Page2.jpg" class="img-fluid" style="border: solid 1px grey;"></div>
                                <div class="w-100"></div>
                                <div class="col-sm-4 py-4 text-center"><img src="images/Home-Page3.jpg" class="img-fluid" style="border: solid 1px grey;"></div>
                                <div class="col-sm-4 py-4 text-center"><img src="images/Home-Page4.jpg" class="img-fluid" style="border: solid 1px grey;"></div>
                        </div>
                        <p>The App looks at which Feed a user is viewing and renders the appropriate information. The data stored using the Feed model is processed through a sorting function and renders the HTML onto the page (React would be used for this.) The Posts are displayed continuously and are rendered On Scroll. The first Page Render contains one single post, the second contains two posts, the third contains four and from the fourth Page Render onwards displays a maximum of 8 posts. I chose to order the pages with an increasing amount of posts, up to 8, to highlight the ones which were deemed ‘more important’ by the users when the feed is set to look at the most popular posts. The App uses the space of the screen to highlight importance.</p>
                        <h2>Saving a Post and Saved Posts Page:</h2>
                        <div class="row justify-content-center">
                                <div class="col-sm-4 py-4 text-center"><img src="images/Saved-Posts.jpg" class="img-fluid" style="border: solid 1px grey;"></div>
                        </div>
                        <p>You can view saved posts by Topic, Feed or All. When viewing the Saved Posts page through a feed, a sorting function looks at only the data from the savedPosts Field of the User model which is a value of Post and renders the data the same way as the Viewing Feeds page.</p>
                        <h2 style=>Donating to Posts:</h2>
                        <div class="row justify-content-center">
                                <div class="col-sm-4 py-4 text-center"><img src="images/Donate-Prompt.jpg" class="img-fluid" style="border: solid 1px grey;"></div>
                        </div>
                        <p>Donating to a post sends the donation to the creator of the post but is also recorded as a value of balance in the Post model. Users are encouraged to send donations to posts which they would like others to see since posts with a higher balance are arranged higher in the feed.</p>
                        <h2>Analysis and Review:</h2>
                        <p>I started this project by developing smart contracts on the Ethereum Network. An account could send transactions to posts which were then sent to the creator of the post, however, problems began to arise when an attempt was made to use the blockchain data to order the posts. This is because these operations require a gas fee which would not have been economical for the users or the app itself. I suspect a solution to this problem would be to use oracles to communicate the blockchain data with the database of the application. This project shows how an auto-governed newsfeed can exist on the assumption that donations can be made easily. In reality, the donations are subject to high transaction fees which I believe are unappealing to the user. You can substitute the donation feature of the app with likes or votes but this will not display an accurate representation of reliable content since this method can be gamed. Nonetheless, I enjoyed looking at how the data can be moved around and organised using the User Interface I designed and working on the fluency of the User Experience.</p>
