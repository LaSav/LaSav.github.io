          <p>
            I wanted to create an app that displayed accurate news. My approach
            to achieving this was to build it using smart contracts on the
            Ethereum Network. Using a decentralised app infrastructure allows
            immutable data and transactions to be a fraction of fiat currency.
            This is not achievable using third party payment systems today. My
            train of thought lead me to believe that if a service allowed you to
            share updates on the world around you and encouraged users to donate
            to promote the notions they found accurate; a space could be created
            without spam, hence more accurate news. However, I soon discovered
            that this was a very ambitious feat; partly due to physical
            limitations of the EVM and blockchain technology at the time and
            partly because of underestimating human behaviour. I was still
            interested in seeing how I could design the user-experience with a
            suitable user-interface to make this app,so I decided to create this
            as a bare-bones UX/UI project with descriptions of first-approach,
            basic application architecture. All Designs were made in Sketch.
          </p>

            Users register with username, email and password. The user data is a
            one-to-many relationship, where one user has many Feeds and Posts.
          </p>
          <h2>Creating a Post:</h2>
          <div class="row justify-content-center">
            <div class="col-sm-4 py-4 text-center">
              <img

          <p>
            The Post model contains fields which include: headline, textBody,
            topicTags, timeCreated, balance and fonts. Headlines are the initial
            thing users read, which are displayed on the user interface of the
            Feed in full- this is achieved by setting a character limit. The
            textBody is the content of the post. topicTags are used to sort the
            Post accordingly using a Sort Function when viewing a feed. Fonts
            are used to personalise your post (this would not be included in the
            MVP design of the app.) timeCreated is a value which is used along
            with balance in a calculation to determine the popularity of the
            Post. Balance is the recorded amount of donations to the Post. Each
            Post has its own id.
          </p>
          <h2>Viewing a Post:</h2>
          <div class="row justify-content-center">
            <div class="col-sm-4 py-4 text-center">

              />
            </div>
          </div>
          <p>
            The headlines and a portion of the Post’s body can be seen when
            looking at a Feed. The higher rated posts reveal larger amounts of
            the Post’s Text Body. Clicking on the Post takes you to the Show
            Post page where the entirety of the post can be seen along with the
            option to save and donate to the Post.
          </p>
          <h2>Creating a Feed:</h2>

          <p>
            The Feed model has fields which include topics and sortBy. On the
            User Interface you select what topics you would like your feed to
            contain, you can select multiple topics. You can choose how the
            created Feed is sorted using the Sort By selector. A User can create
            many Feeds, so you can have specific Feeds dedicated to specific
            types of content.
          </p>
          <h4>Sort By Selector:</h4>
          <p>
            Choosing to sort by 'Popular' arranges the Posts by popularity which
            is done through an algorithm that determines a rate by looking at
            the balance of the post and dividing it by the amount of time it has
            been since it was created. Sorting by 'New' orders the Feed by the
            most recent posts only. You can also set a specific time when
            selecting New (in the last hour/ day/ month.)
          </p>
          <h2>View Feeds:</h2>

            The App looks at which Feed a user is viewing and renders the
            appropriate information. The data stored using the Feed model is
            processed through a sorting function and renders the HTML onto the
            page (React would be used for this.) The Posts are displayed
            continuously and are rendered On Scroll. The first Page Render
            contains one single post, the second contains two posts, the third
            contains four and from the fourth Page Render onwards displays a
            maximum of 8 posts. I chose to order the pages with an increasing
            amount of posts, up to 8, to highlight the ones which were deemed
            ‘more important’ by the users when the feed is set to look at the
            most popular posts. The App uses the space of the screen to
            highlight importance.
          </p>

            </div>
          </div>
          <p>
            You can view saved posts by Topic, Feed or All. When viewing the
            Saved Posts page through a feed, a sorting function looks at only
            the data from the savedPosts Field of the User model which is a
            value of Post and renders the data the same way as the Viewing Feeds
            page.

            </div>
          </div>
          <p>
            Donating to a post sends the donation to the creator of the post but
            is also recorded as a value of balance in the Post model. Users are
            encouraged to send donations to posts which they would like others
            to see since posts with a higher balance are arranged higher in the
            feed.
          </p>
          <h2>Analysis and Review:</h2>
          <p>
            I started this project by developing smart contracts on the Ethereum
            Network. An account could send transactions to posts which were then
            sent to the creator of the post, however, problems began to arise
            when an attempt was made to use the blockchain data to order the
            posts. This is because these operations require a gas fee which
            would not have been economical for the users or the app itself. I
            suspect a solution to this problem would be to use oracles to
            communicate the blockchain data with the database of the
            application. This project shows how an auto-governed newsfeed can
            exist on the assumption that donations can be made easily. In
            reality, the donations are subject to high transaction fees which I
            believe are unappealing to the user. You can substitute the donation
            feature of the app with likes or votes but this will not display an
            accurate representation of reliable content since this method can be
            gamed. Nonetheless, I enjoyed looking at how the data can be moved
            around and organised using the User Interface I designed and working
            on the fluency of the User Experience.
