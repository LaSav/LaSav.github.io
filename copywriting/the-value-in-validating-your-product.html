              Some start their projects by tapping into the code, creating
              feature after feature, swatting bug after bug; others may decide
              to dive straight into marketing, selling at all corners of the
              internet before building. The problem is, you don’t know whether
              the juice is worth the squeeze but you’re squeezing nonetheless.
              I’ve gone down both routes and failed miserably, costing hours of
              valuable time which I should have spent doing the most important
              thing: validating.
            </p>
            <p>
              Granted, for my previous projects my coding and marketing skills
              were novice at best, but the dire, destined result was always
              going to be the same, simply because I wasn’t careful enough with
              planning. And no, my latest project isn’t a hit (yet), but what I
              am proud of sharing is the renewable validation system I have
              created using a little bit of HTML, javaScript and Google Apps
              Script, along with basic web design and marketing practices. The
              result was this:
              <a href="https://www.boundnetwork.com">www.boundnetwork.com</a>
            </p>
            <h3>The Idea</h3>
            <p>
              For those of you who didn’t click the link, Bound is a directory
              for digital creatives to build projects together, and besides a
              few more details found on the landing page, that’s all the visitor
              of the site has to know for now. I’m not talking about all of the
              amazing features Bound is going to have (which it will) because I
              don’t know if I need to build them out yet. I first want to engage
              with potential users and listen to what they have to say so I can
              return them an optimal networking product.
            </p>
            <h3>The Method</h3>
            <p>
              Validating is a key stage in the development cycle of a new
              product or feature. It involves testing with potential users to
              see if a proposed solution will be accepted. Here is a breakdown
              of the validation method I developed:
            </p>
            <ol style="line-height: 2">
              <li>
                Deploy and host a static website highlighting the central idea
                of the product. In Bound’s case, the idea is to help digital
                creatives find each other to collaborate.
              </li>
              <li>
                Include a sign up form with appropriate inputs. Unless your
                product requires additional information from the users, only ask
                for absolutely necessary details, the best practice is to only
                ask for email.
              </li>
              <li>
                Test your idea to see if it solves the problem by including
                feedback surveys when emailing users. Or just look at the sign
                up rate of users.
              </li>
            </ol>
            <h3>The Results</h3>
            <ul style="line-height: 2; list-style-position: inside">
              <li>
                <strong>Development after feedback.</strong> After conducting
                research in step 3, I can create a feature based on the feedback
                and continue testing the reception of that feature after launch.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Preferable marketing solutions.</strong> Building the
                site from scratch means faster speeds and smoother analytics
                integration, hence better SEO (Search Engine Optimisation)
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>A fail-safe.</strong> If the product is received poorly
                at step 3, I can scrap it or re-work steps 1 & 2 and try again.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Sustainability.</strong> The next time I want to launch
                a new product, I can use the same approach since the setup and
                the code is already developed.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Saving time and money.</strong> No unwanted features/
                products are built.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Developing a renewable validation system like this could be an
              important asset to individuals who frequently release, integrate
              or promote new products and solutions. You also don’t need to
              program your own mailing system or host your own landing page,
              there’s third party tools that already offer this. The trade-off
              using these tools is a decrease in SEO, but if you just want to
              gauge your audience’s response, they’re perfectly adequate
              solutions.
            </p>
            <p>
              Validating your product omits pain points in the development cycle
              and saves critical time and money; something I wish someone had
              told me a few years ago- which is also the reason I started to
              develop Bound, a place for digital creatives to build solutions
              together.
