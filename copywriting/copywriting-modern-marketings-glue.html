              Many modern marketing approaches move in tandem with technological
              advances, utilising up to date tools to keep up with the growing
              use of the internet. These tools are used collectively to grow
              audiences by monitoring, testing and iterating marketing
              strategies.
            </p>
            <p>
              Growth marketing consists of various elements including CRO
              (Conversion Rate Optimisation), SEO (Search Engine Optimisation),
              UX/ UI (User Experience/ User Interface) design and analytics; but
              allow me to hone in on one practical, creative component
              underpinning all of these elements: Copywriting.
            </p>
            <h3>The Lifecycle of the Click</h3>
            <p>
              When executed correctly, these methods work harmoniously; feeding
              and blending into one another. Actions, or ‘clicks’ will be
              visually guided to by using effective design, then, those clicks
              will be monitored and revised using site analytic techniques and
              methods. But no one will ever make an action if they don’t
              understand why they should, which is where clear, concise copy
              comes into play.
            </p>
            <h3>What is Copywriting</h3>
            <p>
              Sitting somewhere in between a behavioural science and an art,
              copywriting is the process of composing persuasive text to
              convince the reader to make an action; whether it be signing up to
              a newsletter, making a donation or making a purchase.
            </p>
            <h3>Why it's Important</h3>
            <p>
              From a business perspective it’s used to generate more leads,
              hence more sales. However, there’s also a duty to promote products
              with potential to ensure proper usage in its target community. For
              instance, a ground-breaking product may get developed but never
              have the chance to enter the larger market because it was not
              accurately depicted, promoted or described.
            </p>
            <h3>A Few Rules to Write Effective Copy</h3>
            <h4>Rule no. 1</h4>
            <p><strong>Know Your Audience</strong></p>
            <p>
              A website for a veterinary clinic will have different copy to a
              website for a theme park. Determining the correct TOV (Tone Of
              Voice) should be the first step in producing good copy. The copy
              should be in line with the tone of the product/ service for the
              site: exhilarating and joyful copy for the Theme Park, comforting
              and reassuring copy for the Veterinary Clinic. The TOV proves to
              the reader they’re on the right track for their search from first
              glance, keeping them engaged to continue reading.
            </p>
            <h4>Rule no. 2</h4>
            <p><strong>Clarity</strong></p>
            <p>
              Your audience should always understand why the text they are
              reading is useful for them. Do not fill your sentences with
              unnecessary information, only include what they need to know and,
              more importantly, why they need to know this information. For
              Short Form copy (headlines, sub-headlines, social media posts)
              this will be a matter of words, for Long Form Copy (blog posts,
              press releases, technical analyses) this will be a matter of words
              in the sentence and sentences in the paragraph.
            </p>
            <h4>Rule no. 3</h4>
            <p><strong>Brevity</strong></p>
            <p>Be brief.</p>
            <h4>Rule no. 4</h4>
            <p><strong>Honesty</strong></p>
            <p>
              Do not lie to your audience. Not only may this result in legal
              troubles (depending on the severity of the false message) but it
              will irritate the reader and build a bad, unreliable reputation
              around your company, costing you a.) a potential customer and b.)
              a return customer/ return visitor. You must always maintain a good
              rapport with your audience
            </p>
            <h4>Rule no. 5</h4>
            <p><strong>Editing</strong></p>
            <p>
              Edit. Then edit some more. Copywriting is a creative and
              destructive process, you should trim the text of any unnecessary
              information by referencing and iterating the other rules until you
              get to a point where you’re happy with the copy, or better yet-
              until you’ve convinced yourself that you’re happy with the copy.
            </p>
            <h3>
              How Copywriting Resonates with Other Growth Marketing Elements
            </h3>
            <p><strong>CRO</strong></p>
            <p>
              Conversion Rate Optimisation is monitoring how many people visit
              your site or make an action. If your copy is clear, the visitor
              understands the product to a level which is substantial enough for
              them to make a decision on an action.
            </p>
            <p>
              One way of doing this is by acutely summarising your product in a
              headline. People do not dwell on sites unless they are captivated
              at first glance. You should write headlines as if they’re the only
              information that is available to the reader about your product,
              aiming to secure an action straight off the bat.
            </p>
            <p>
              Honest copy instills the customer with a sense of validation,
              reassuring them that, in the future, your product will continue to
              deliver accurately. It also directly affects your analytics, good
              input = good output.
            </p>
            <p>
              Your copy must be true to the word. This is particularly important
              for early stage products. For example, do not make false promises
              like: “Sign up to receive access to our Beta” and then not provide
              such access. This will corrupt the data going into your analytics
              because the customers are recorded as being interested in your
              product on the pretence of a deliverable. Would they have signed
              up if the Beta was not on offer? You’ll never know, and now your
              projections for future analyses are stunted.
            </p>
            <p><strong>SEO</strong></p>
            <p>
              Search Engine Optimisation is a method which improves quality and
              quantity of network traffic to a website from search engines;
              targeting natural, organic results. SEO writing involves choosing
              keywords to include in your text and other places on the site
              (meta tags, titles, etc.) for the search engine to scan and flag
              them for relevant searches.
            </p>
            <p>
              Unlike writing copy for short form content like a twitter post,
              choosing SEO keywords is less creatively liberal. It’s a reverse
              engineering process, logically choosing keywords which highlight
              your text as briefly and effectively as possible will be most
              advantageous in ranking your page higher up in the results list.
            </p>
            <p><strong>UX/ UI</strong></p>
            <p>
              By combining captivating copy and eye-catching design, your site
              will increase the retention time of visitors, thereby increasing
              the likelihood of an action being taken.
            </p>
            <p>
              The tone of voice used in the copy should match the design choices
              of the website. Using the Theme Park and Veterinary clinic example
              again; bright and warm colours along with exhilarating and joyful
              copy being used for the theme park website indicate to the visitor
              that they’re in the right place to find thrilling rides and
              amusement, and not the place for them to bring their dog with an
              upset stomach.
            </p>
            <p>
              Entering a new site can be dis-orientating, especially when the
              site is text-heavy. Creating shrewd prompts for the user to easily
              navigate across the site will increase accessibility: this can
              vary from choosing appropriate page names in the nav bar to the
              choice of text for additional links on pages.
            </p>
            <p><strong>A/B Testing</strong></p>
            <p>
              A/B testing is used in growth marketing to determine which version
              (A: the control version or B: the variable version) of the site
              produces better results. When it comes to A/B testing, the
              predominant changes to be made will be to the written elements of
              the site, after all, these are the prompts for actions to occur.
              This may include adding names to email subject lines or tweaking
              headlines and headers to see which perform better in the testing
              variable version. In fact, A/B testing for online marketing was
              inspired by the principles found in direct response marketing
              popularised in the early 20th century.
            </p>
            <h3>Transcending the Digital Threshold</h3>
            <p>
              Unlike the other online marketing elements, the effects of
              copywriting can seep into the physical world. Providing clear,
              concise copy consistently across all mediums of your product will
              generate public buzz through word of mouth.

              The rising concerns with privacy surrounds targeted ads with an
              invasive nature, associating online marketing’s big data
              approaches with a negative connotation. When hearing a
              recommendation from a friend or a co-worker, it feels much more
              genuine than having an ad targeted at you. This is because
              targeted ads are synthetically personalised by a third party using
              a third party tool, something which is widely known by the public.
              Whereas, hearing a recommendation from a real person is a genuine
              personal exchange because they know you on an individual level.

              Writing copy which accurately depicts the product will increase
              the likelihood of a recommendation. If the reader can effortlessly
              understand the benefits and use cases of your product from your
              promotions, they’ll be able to recite that information
              effortlessly to others. Don’t just write copy that sells, write
              copy that sells selling.

            <h3>Butterfly Effect</h3>
            <p>
              At its core, copywriting is simply about communicating. When it
              comes to selling a product, choosing what you communicate will
              invoke different types of actions. These actions are what drive
              the analytics modern marketing is heavily based around; picking
              what you say, how you say it and when you say it will steer the
              market which you’re analysing in different directions, so pick
              wisely.
