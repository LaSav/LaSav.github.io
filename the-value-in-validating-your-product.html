                                                    <h1>The Value in Validating your Product</h1>

                                    <div class="row justify-content-center" style="line-height: 1.8;">
                                            <p>Some start their projects by tapping into the code, creating feature after feature, swatting bug after bug; others may decide to dive straight into marketing, selling at all corners of the internet before building. The problem is, you don’t know whether the juice is worth the squeeze but you’re squeezing nonetheless. I’ve gone down both routes and failed miserably, costing hours of valuable time which I should have spent doing the most important thing: validating.</p>
                                            <p>Granted, for my previous projects my coding and marketing skills were novice at best but the dire, destined result was always going to be the same, simply because I wasn’t careful enough with planning. And no, my latest project isn’t a hit (yet), but what I am proud of sharing is the renewable validation system I have created using a little bit of HTML, javaScript and Google Apps Script, along with basic web design and marketing practices. The result was this: <a href="https://www.boundnetwork.com">www.boundnetwork.com</a></p>
                                            <h3>The Idea</h3>
                                            <p>For those of you who didn’t click the link, Bound is a directory for digital creatives to build projects together, and besides a few more details found on the landing page, that’s all the visitor of the site has to know for now. I’m not talking about all of the amazing features Bound is going to have (which it will) because I don’t know if I need to build them out yet. I first want to engage with potential users and listen to what they have to say so I can return them an optimal networking product.</p>
                                            <h3>The Method</h3>
                                            <p>Validating is a key stage in the development cycle of a new product or feature. It involves testing with potential users to see if a proposed solution will be accepted. Here is a breakdown of the validation method I developed:</p>
                                            <ol style="line-height: 2;">
                                                <li>Deploy and host a static website highlighting the central idea of the product. In Bound’s case, the idea is to help digital creatives find each other to collaborate.</li>
                                                <li>Include a sign up form with appropriate inputs. Unless your product requires additional information from the users, only ask for absolutely necessary details, the best practice is to only ask for email.</li>
                                                <li>Test your idea to see if it solves the problem by including feedback surveys when emailing users. Or just look at the sign up rate of users.</li>
                                            </ol>
                                            <h3>The Results</h3>
                                            <ul style="line-height: 2;">
                                                <li>Development after feedback. After conducting research in step 3, I can create a feature based on the feedback and continue testing the reception of that feature after launch.</li>
                                                <li>Preferable marketing solutions. Building the site from scratch means faster speeds and smoother analytics integration, hence better SEO (Search Engine Optimisation)</li>
                                                <li>A fail-safe. If the product is received poorly at step 3, I can scrap it or re-work steps 1 & 2 and try again.</li>
                                                <li>Sustainability. The next time I want to launch a new product, I can use the same approach since the setup and the code is already developed.</li>
                                                <li>Saving time and money. No unwanted features/ products are built.</li>
                                            </ul>
                                            <p>Developing a renewable validation system like this could be an important asset to individuals who frequently release, integrate or promote new products and solutions. You also don’t need to program your own mailing system or host your own landing page, there’s third party tools that already offer this. The trade-off using these tools is a decrease in SEO, but if you just want to gauge your audience’s response, they’re perfectly adequate solutions.</p>
                                            <p>Validating your product omits pain points in the development cycle and saves critical time and money; something I wish someone had told me a few years ago- which is also the reason I started to develop Bound, a place for digital creatives to build solutions together.</p>
